# video-player

![Deploy](https://github.com/dalyIsaac/video-player/workflows/Deploy/badge.svg)

This is a PWA for playing local video files. I built this to play downloaded videos of lectures. Other video players were missing some functionality (such as my preferred shortcuts), and others didn't perform well. My rationale for building this player was to piggy-back on top of browsers' native video-playing experiences.
